Here’s a **professional, well-structured README** for your **Ahad Job Portal** project:

# 🧑‍💼 Ahad Job Portal

A **microservices-based Job Portal Application** built with **Spring Boot**, providing secure, scalable, and event-driven architecture.
It connects **Users** and **Companies**, enabling job creation, application, and real-time notifications — all managed through **Spring Cloud**, **Kafka**, and **JWT Authentication**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Ahad Job Portal** is designed using a **microservices architecture**, where each module (User, Company, Job, Notification, Auth, etc.) operates independently and communicates through **Apache Kafka**.
It supports **JWT-based Authentication** for secure access and **Spring Cloud Gateway** for API routing and filtering.

---

## 🧩 Microservices Architecture

### 1. **User-Service**

* Handles user registration, update, and profile management.
* Manages job applications submitted by users.
* Exposes REST APIs for retrieving user details.

### 2. **Company-Service**

* Manages company registration, updates, and profile data.
* Allows companies to post new jobs and view applicants.

### 3. **Job-Service**

* Handles job creation, retrieval, and management.
* Connects companies and users through job postings and applications.
* Triggers events to **Notification-Service** upon new job postings or application updates.

### 4. **Notification-Service**

* Listens to Kafka topics to receive real-time events.
* Sends notifications when:

  * A new job is posted.
  * A user's application status changes.

### 5. **Auth-Service**

* Responsible for login and JWT token generation.
* Validates tokens for secured endpoints across microservices.
* Supports role-based access control (e.g., USER, COMPANY).

### 6. **API Gateway**

* Routes incoming requests to appropriate microservices.
* Validates JWT tokens before forwarding.
* Central entry point for all client interactions.

### 7. **Eureka Server**

* Service discovery and registration.
* Helps all microservices locate and communicate with each other dynamically.

### 8. **Config Server**

* Centralized configuration management using Spring Cloud Config.
* Loads configuration files from GitHub Repository:

| **Database**          | MySQL                     |
| **Build Tool**        | Maven                     |
| **Version Control**   | Git & GitHub              |

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User or Company registers through respective services.
2. Login credentials are verified by **Auth-Service**.
3. A **JWT Token** is generated and returned.
4. Every request passes through the **API Gateway**, which validates the JWT token.
5. Role-based access (USER or COMPANY) determines available actions.

---

## 🔄 Event-Driven Communication (Kafka)

* **Producer:** Job-Service (on new job creation or status change).
* **Consumer:** Notification-Service (listens and updates users/companies).
* Enables **asynchronous communication** for scalable performance.

## 🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the project**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harunsheikh42786/Ahad-Job.git
   cd Ahad-Job
   ```

2. **Run Config Server**

   * Configure `application.yml` to point to your config repo:

     ```yaml
     spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=https://github.com/harunsheikh42786/Ahad-Job-Configs.git
     ```

3. **Start Eureka Server**

   * Run the Eureka application to register services dynamically.

4. **Start Other Microservices**

   * Run `User-Service`, `Company-Service`, `Job-Service`, `Notification-Service`, `Auth-Service`, and `API Gateway`.

5. **Kafka Setup**

   * Ensure Kafka is installed and running locally or in Docker.
   * Update Kafka configuration in each service’s `application.yml`.

6. **Access Application**

   * API Gateway: `http://localhost:8080`
   * Eureka Dashboard: `http://localhost:8761`

Would you like me to include **sample Postman requests** (for register, login, job creation, etc.) and a **diagram (architecture + flow)** for the README too? That would make it even more professional for GitHub.
